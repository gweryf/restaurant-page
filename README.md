## About The Project

A tavern landing page created using npm, webpack, and JavaScript is a dynamic, modern website that showcases a charming, traditional tavern experience. This landing page is built with advanced web development tools and techniques, making it faster and more efficient than a traditional website. It features high-quality images, interactive elements, and a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. The use of JavaScript allows for seamless navigation and user-friendly interactions, such as dropdown menus and hover effects. With the power of webpack, the tavern landing page can be optimized for performance, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable browsing experience. Visitors to the tavern landing page can easily browse menus, learn about upcoming events, and get a sense of the tavern's unique atmosphere, encouraging them to visit in person and enjoy all the tavern has to offer.
